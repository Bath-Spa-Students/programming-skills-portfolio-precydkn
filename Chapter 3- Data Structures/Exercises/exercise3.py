"""Exercise 3: Your Own List 
Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. 
Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.” """

It's been so long since I've ridden a {myTranspo[1]}, but I would like to own a black or blue one and ride it during the winter.

I don't know what brand of {myTranspo[2]}, but I'd like to own one and drive my family and friends wherever they want.

I don't think I'll ever learn to ride one, but I think {myTranspo[3]}s are cool.''')
