## Exercise 5: Favorite Fruit 
'''Make a list of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your list.
•   Make a list of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.
•   Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your list. If the fruit is in your list, 
    the if block should print a statement, such as You really like bananas!'''

favorite_fruits = ["orange" , "mango" , "grapes"]

if "orange" in favorite_fruits: 
    print("You really like oranges!")

if "banana" in favorite_fruits:
    print("You really like bananas!")

if "grapes" in favorite_fruits: 
    print("You really like grapes!")

if "mango" in favorite_fruits: 
    print("You really like mangoes!")

if "strawberry" in favorite_fruits:
    print("You really like strawberries!")
